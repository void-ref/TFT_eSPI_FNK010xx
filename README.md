# TFT_eSPI Configurations for FNK010XX

[TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI) setup files for FNK010XX ESP32 Displays. Compatible with PlatformIO.

The configuration files were originally created by Freenove and uploaded to their GitHub repository as a
[ZIP archive](https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_ESP32_Display/blob/199c9c9ec857e171afd49bac470c26694a72caf3/Libraries/TFT_eSPI_Setups_v1.0.zip).
All I've done is unzip those files (commit [`199c9c9`](https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_ESP32_Display/tree/199c9c9ec857e171afd49bac470c26694a72caf3))
and shuffle them around a little.
